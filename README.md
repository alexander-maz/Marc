# MARC
#### A tiny Markov chain generator in JavaScript

Easily create Markov models from a given set of observations to generate random
sequences of _potential_ observations.

#### Usage
```
import Marc from 'marc';
// Our observations consist of four sentences from a rando's Twitter account
const observations = ['a sentence', 'another sentence', 'one more', 'and the last'];
// Give Mark the observations and tell it our token delimeter (' ')
const m = new Mark(observations, ' ');
// Generate a probable observation
const random = m.random();
```

#### Run the example
```
$> npm run example
```
